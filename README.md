# PAYLOAD #

This kind of game mode is known from Team Fortress, Overwatch, CoD and many other titles.
One team needs to deliver the payload (a spotted PvE AI) to the final outpost while the other team is trying to stop it or even push it back. The payload is being moved by being close to it with more people than the other team. Pushing (or blocking) the payload will make you earn scorepoints.

I set up some flavours of the mode:
- 2042: all maps are played with 2042 soldiers and specialties
- OF AGES: the battlefield era and soldiers are determined by the map
- PVE-AI: This mode should usually be used when playing online, as it will ensure that the "payload"-bots will stay ingame
- PVP-AI: This mode could be used, if you play with less players, but want to have the server filled with AI (note: as soon as the server would get full, the "payload" bots will vanish and there is no visual indicator for the payload anymore)
